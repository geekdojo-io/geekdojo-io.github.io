## Review

### Last week's homework:

* Caesar Cipher -- https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/caesar-cipher-1/problem
* Closest Numbers - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/closest-numbers/problem
* Find the Median - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/find-the-median/problem

#### Tips on solving problems

* Read a problem statement twice! (Don't solve a wrong problem!)
* Measure twice, cut once! (Write a concrete example on a paper, write an algorithm or peusdo-code, and test the algorithm before starting to write code)
* After solving a problem, study Editorial and view solutions in Discussion.
* Upsolve - Don't waste time solving easy problems. Challenge yourself.

## Quiz

```py
class Solution:
    def isUnique(self, s: str) -> bool:
	# TODO: Determin if a string has all unique characters.
        pass


sol = Solution()
assert sol.isUnique('abc') == True
assert sol.isUnique('abcda') == False
```
